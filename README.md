- The file needs to have 4 columns of content.

- You can only upload Excel files.(If you are working with Mac's Numbers, you can export the file to Excel in File --> Export to --> Excel...).

- File must be smaller than 2MB.

- You can download the empty template to fill with words of your own, or you can use our pre-filled table to try the game out!
